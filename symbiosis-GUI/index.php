                <p>As famously put by Marc Andreessen over 10 years ago, **"software is eating the world"**, and many individuals and organizations are still struggling to adapt to the pace of changing technology.</p> 
                    
                <p>Adding fuel to this fire is a life post-pandemic, which has accelerated digital adoption for almost _all_ businesses to survive and remain viable enterprises. Simultaneously, the ever changing work place landscape asks for new models for the future of work to address the key skill shortages of specialized technical resources and the desire for flexible, global, equitable and sustainable work has made it extremely difficult for organizations and individuals to navigate.</p>
